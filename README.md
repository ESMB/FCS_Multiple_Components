1) Run Get_Tau_Value.py on free dye to determine diffusion coefficient of first component. 
2) Copy Green_td and Red_td values from the output. 
3) Paste these into FCS_Fit_Multi_Tau.py, and then run on the various files. Output will be f1 and f2, which are free dye, and second component fractions. 

FCS_Fit_Dye.py is to determine the width and height of confocal volume from a sample with known diffusion coefficient (dye, for example).
